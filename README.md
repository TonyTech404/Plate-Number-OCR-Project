## Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the process of reading license plate numbers from images. This can be useful for various applications such as automated toll collection, parking management, and law enforcement.

## Setup
1. **Open the Notebook**: Upload the `Plate_Number_OCR_Project.ipynb` notebook to your Google Colab.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the first cell in the notebook to install necessary libraries.
3. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure that you have images of license plates that you want to process.

## Usage
1. **Load the Image**: Provide the path to the image containing the license plate.
2. **Preprocess the Image**: The notebook includes steps to preprocess the image, such as resizing and grayscale conversion.
3. **Detect and Read Plate Number**: The notebook uses a deep learning model to detect and read the text from the license plate.
4. **Display Results**: The results, including the detected license plate and recognized text, are displayed on the image.

### Example
To run the notebook, follow these steps:
- Upload your image files to the Colab environment.
- Modify the `IMAGE_PATH` variable to point to your image.
- Run all cells to process the image and display the results.

## Results
The processed image with detected license plate and recognized text is displayed inline within the notebook. The recognized text is also printed as output.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `pytesseract`
- `PIL`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```python
!pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib pytesseract pillow
```
